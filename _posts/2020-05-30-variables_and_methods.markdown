â€‹
Variables and methods are metaphors to life because in a way we use similar tools to learn, reference, and categorize every day things, people, and events. Our brain uses "variables" throughout the day, it operates like Marie Kondo on steroids in real life. Instead of using code, our brain uses chemical patterns or electrical signals that are passed from one neuron to the next forming a neural network. Constantly working and finding an appropriate place for every person, thing, or event that we encounter throughout our life.  

Methods in real life are used when we put all of our gathered and stored information about the world to use. Methods are like information bundles. It's like shopping at Best Buy and purchasing your first computer, but because you've never had a laptop before you now have to buy all the things you've researched that is needed for your computer setup to be epic and to help increase productivity
