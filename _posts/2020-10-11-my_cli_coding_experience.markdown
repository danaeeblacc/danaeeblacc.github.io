I'll be lying if I said my coding journey has been a pie of cake, it's quite the opposite really. My CLI project has definitely triggered my  imposter syndrome. From the beginning of my coding journey I feel like everything was rushed and crammed into a couple of weeks. I felt very unprepared, I lack confidence and support. I started this journey with a clear and open mind, knowing that it would require hard work and dedication. I thought to myself I knocked  3 degrees down, how hard can a coding course be?”. Apparently it's pretty freaking hard. Aside from the fact that I really had no idea what I was doing, I never felt like I had the support to learn (having an instructor/teacher) during the module learning process. Often when I asked for help  I heard the words,” did you google it ?”. I mean, I don't mind googling but what exactly do I google if I have no idea what I am doing. It's all very frustrating. Asking for help results in  either hearing “Go to google” or “How do you think we go about fixing this issue (honestly, if truly knew the answer or where to start I would not have asked for help). In addition, it's feeling completely dumb during and after asking my leads for assistance. I had no idea coding was a self-taught kind of skill. I thought the benefit of  being in would decrease the feeling of being  alone. In attempts to grasp a better understanding,  I even tried buying additional resources such as books, and read blogs, but I still felt like I was not understand.
