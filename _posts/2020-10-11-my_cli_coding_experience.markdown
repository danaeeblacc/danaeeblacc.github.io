<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> I will be lying if I said my coding journey has been a pie of cake, it's quite the opposite really. My CLI project has definitely triggered my  imposter syndrome. From the beginning of my coding journey I feel like everything was rushed and crammed into a couple of weeks. I felt very unprepared, and lacked confidence and support. I started this journey with a clear and open mind, knowing that it would require hard work and dedication. I often thought to myself,"I knocked  3 degrees down, how hard can a coding course be?”. Apparently it's pretty freaking hard. Aside from the fact that I really had no idea what I was doing, I never felt like I had the support to learn (having an instructor/teacher) during the module learning process. Though we did have pod meetings on certain labs I still struggled. Often when I asked for help  I heard the words,” did you google it ?”. I mean, I don't mind googling but what exactly do I google if I have no idea what I am doing. Those words were  deadly to me. It's all very frustrating. Asking for help resulted in  either hearing “Go to google” or “How do you think we go about fixing this issue (This murdered me as well). In addition, I also felt completely dumb during and after asking my leads for assistance. They did their best.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> In attempts to grasp a better understanding of ruby,  I also bought additional resources such as books, and read blogs, to assist me with my coding. I pushed on and kept reviewing all my notes and past pod meeting videos. This review process and my books is what assisted me with building my code. Though it took hours to do this, I felt somewhat comfortable carrying on with the project. Though the process of building my CLI was tedious, it felt very rewarding at the end of it all. By refreshing all that I had learned over the past short weeks and accepting  help (this as also a big thing for me) for fellow cohort mates and my lead I was able to create a very fun Harry Potter CLI. I do still a little rusty with remembering all the coding terminologies, but I am a bit more confident in what is needs to make a code run.  I am happy that I was able to complete the project and regain my confidence.
