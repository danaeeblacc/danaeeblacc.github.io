I'l be lying if I said my coding jouney has been a pie of cake, it's quite the opposite really. My CLI poject has definitely triggered my  imposter syndrome. I started this journey with a clear and open mind, knowing that it would require hard work and dedication . I thought to myself " I knocked  3 degrees down, how hard can a coding course be?'. Apparently it's pretty freaking hard. Aside from the fact that I really had no idea what i was doing , i never really felt like i had support to learn. Often when i asked for help  i heard the words," did you google it ? ". I mean , i don't mind googling but what exactly do i google if i have no idea what i a m doing. It's all very frustrating . I either hear "go to google" or I fell really dumb after asking my leads for help.
